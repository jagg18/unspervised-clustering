# Socio-Economic and Health Data Analysis: Clustering and Aid Allocation Strategy

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook provides a comprehensive analysis of socio-economic and health data to develop an effective aid allocation strategy. The analysis involves clustering countries based on key indicators and determining how to allocate aid funds to maximize impact.

## Contents

- **Data Analysis**: Exploration of socio-economic and health data for various countries.
- **Clustering**: Implementation of K-means clustering algorithm to group countries based on their socio-economic and health characteristics.
- **Aid Allocation Strategy**: Calculation of funding requirements for each cluster and proposal for aid distribution.
- **Visualization**: Graphs and plots illustrating the relationship between total health spending, total fertility, and other indicators.

## Data

The dataset used includes indicators such as:
- Total fertility rate
- Total health spending
- Economic factors (e.g., GDP, income)
- Health metrics (e.g., life expectancy, child mortality)

## Key Findings

1. **Cluster Analysis**: Countries were grouped into two clusters based on their socio-economic and health data.
2. **Aid Distribution**: A strategy was developed to allocate funds based on cluster needs, prioritizing countries with higher socio-economic challenges.
